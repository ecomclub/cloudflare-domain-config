Configure domain to E-Com Plus store with Cloudflare API

```bash
node ./main.js yandex-api-key auth-header tcp-port
```
We use a npm package called [translate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/translate), to translate the messages to portuguese. Besides that, we have to create a yandex-api-key for running this package, to get the api-key you can access the [Yandex documentation](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/) and create yours for free.
